# TerraMind Innovators Award 🌍✨  

A **bi-monthly challenge** spotlighting the boldest, most imaginative ways to push TerraMind beyond “just another fine-tune”. 
Whether you’re prototyping a new multi-modal workflow, exploring Thinking-in-Modalities, or inventing a never-seen geospatial application, we want you to share it with everyone.

## 🎯 What’s in it for you?
* **€1 000 cash** for each round winner (June, August, October, December).  
* **Grand Final Prize** — Community prestige and more, decided in January from the four round winners.  
* Potential publication in a joint wrap-up paper with all winners and broad visibility across IBM, ESA, and the EO community.

2. **Technical Quality** – sound methodology, thoughtful experiments, clear visuals.  
3. **Extension of TerraMind** – creative use of multi-modal inputs, generative outputs, TiM chains, etc.  
4. **Open Science & Reproducibility** – **mandatory**. Share code, models, and data splits (or a clear plan for restricted data).

## 📬 How to submit
1. Start a **new discussion** in the [Community](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ibm-esa-geospatial/community/discussions) tab and describe your solution.
2. Keep it under **1 000 words** – include images, tables, and a clear **contact email**.
