# TerraMind Blue-Sky Challenge 🌍✨

A **bi-monthly award** spotlighting the boldest, most imaginative ways to push TerraMind beyond “just another fine-tune”. 
Whether you’re prototyping a new multi-modal workflow, exploring Thinking-in-Modalities, or inventing a never-seen geospatial application, we want you to share it with everyone.

## 🎯 What’s in it for you?
* **€1 000 cash** for each round winner (June, August, October, December).  
* **Grand Final Prize** — Community prestige and more, decided in January from the four round winners.  
* Potential publication in a joint wrap-up paper with all winners and broad visibility across IBM, ESA, and the EO community.
